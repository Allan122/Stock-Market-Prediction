This project focuses on predicting stock market trends and prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop models that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data and market indicators. The project encompasses data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### Objectives
- Analyze historical stock market data to identify trends and patterns.
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and creating relevant indicators.
- Train machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, or Recurrent Neural Networks for stock price prediction.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
